## Overview

This project was proposed through the Frontend Mentor website and was developed entirely by me. 

With it the user has the experience of subscribing to a fictitious newsletter where a registration is made that generates the validation of e-mail, in case where the e-mail is incorrect the site generates an error span and otherwise the e-mail is confirmed and the user can view a card with the confirmation of registration. 

The site has a responsive screen size for both mobile phones and tablets and desktops and for the creation I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
